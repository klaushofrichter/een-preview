# Prompts

## Initial 
We want to build a simple Vue3 application using javascript with node 20.17 that allows the user to entert an access token and a camera identifier. That data is used to call a sequence of API calls to the Eagle Eye Networks service to display a proview image. The API calls should be in a separate javascript file. 

## store input data
when clicking "get preview", store the Accesstoken and the camera id in local storage. When starting the app, check if the accesstoken and camera id can be retrieved from local storage.
